1. #### What is Synchronous and Asynchronous programming and describe the differences between them?

**Synchronous:** In synchronous operations tasks are performed one at a time and only when one is completed, the following is unblocked. In other words, you need to wait for a task to finish to move to the next one.

**Key points:**

- In Synchronous transmission, Data is sent in the form of blocks or frames.
- In Synchronous transmission, the time interval of transmission is constant.

**Asynchronous:** In asynchronous operations, on the other hand, you can move to another task before the previous one finishes. This way, with asynchronous programming youâ€™re able to deal with multiple requests simultaneously, thus completing more tasks in a much shorter period of time.

**Key Points:**

- Asynchronous does not mean concurrent or multi threaded.
- In asynchronous transmission, Data is sent in the form of byte or character.
- In asynchronous transmission, the time interval of transmission is not constant, it is random.

2. #### How can we deal with asynchronous code?

There are three patterns we can deal with asynchronous code.

1. ##### Callback:

   A callback is a function when an asynchronous function is ready.

   ```js
   const getUser = (id, callback) => {
     logger("Data fetxhing start>3000....");
     setTimeout(() => {
       callback({ id: id, name: "limon" });
     }, 2000);
   };
   const getRopository = (user, callback) => {
     logger("Repositorty fetching start>3000....", user);
     setTimeout(() => {
       callback(["repo1", "repo2", "repo3"]);
     }, 2000);
   };
   getUser(1, (user) => {
     getRopository(user.name, (repo) => {
       logger("Repos:", repo);
     });
   });
   ```

2. ##### Promise:

   Promise is an object that holds the eventual result of an asynchronous function.Initially it's an independent state when we create the promises. Anywhere we have an asynchronous function that takes a callback we should modify that function to return a promise.

   ```js
   const p = () =>
     new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       // kick off some async work
       // ...
       setTimeout(() => {
         // resolve({ id: id, profile: "limon" });//pending=>resolved,fulfilled
         reject(new Error("error-occured")); //pending=>reject,fulfilled
       }, 2000);
     });
   // consume the promise
   p.then((result) => console.log("Result:", result)).catch((err) =>
     console.log(err.message)
   );
   ```

3. ##### async/await:

   The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style.

   ```js
   function getUser(id) {
     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       setTimeout(() => {
         console.log("Getting a user from a database");
         resolve({ id: id, profile: "limon" });
       }, 2000);
     });
   }
   async function displayUser() {
     try {
       const user = await getUser(1);
       console.log(user);
     } catch (error) {
       console.log(error.message);
     }
   }
   ```

##### Anonymos Function:

A function that does not have a name.
